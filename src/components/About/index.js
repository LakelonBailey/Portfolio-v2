        <p>
          I am a computer science student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am also currently working as a part-time software developer with <a href="https://makememodern.com">MakeMeModern</a>. I love to code both as a job as well as a hobby.
          I am also interested in many athletic activities such as competitive swimming, olympic-style weightlifting, and many more.
